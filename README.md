## Description of project
Our team will create an inventory system to help our client stay organized and updated on her items.

She owns a small balloon business, where she makes 'bouquets' or balloons for special occasions (parties, retirements, etc.). She opperates from home, alone, and currently keeps track of her stock via Excel, which can get pretty messy. This is where our web application comes in.
The software we will develop will have 5 databases related to her inventory and orders: balloons, items, clients, status, and orders.
  - Balloons will store different types of balloons, based on color, size, shape, and more.
  - Items will store extra items our client uses in her 'bouquets'. Some examples would include plushies, ribbons, and baskets.
  - Clients will simply consists of her clients, as well as different methods to contact them.
  - Status will have the order numbers and the status of the order.
  - Orders will be the big table that links them all together. It will take from balloons and items what it needs for said order, the client's name from the client table and the status of the order from the status table.

The different pages will include a simple login/register page, a menu sidebar once logged in, different pages for the tables (to view/search and another to add/update/delete for each), a report page, a past orders page, a low stock page, and a new order/delete order page. The menu sidebar would be present at every screen to keep an easy flow throughout the web application. If a table is choosen, a page with its view will appear and some buttons will allow the user to modify or search through it. The Past Orders Page will have square containers which are formed with a picture (which the user needs to upload to the web application) and the sell price of that order.

Basic tables will be the following -> Balloons, Items, Clients, and Status tables
