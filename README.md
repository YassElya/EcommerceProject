## Description of project
Our team will create an inventory system to help our client stay organized and updated on her items.

She owns a small balloon business, where she makes 'bouquets' or balloons for special occasions (parties, retirements, etc.). She opperates from home, alone, and currently keeps track of her stock via Excel, which can get pretty messy. This is where our web application comes in.
The software we will develop will have 5 databases: balloons, items, clients, status, and orders.
  - Balloons will store different types of balloons, based on color, size, shape, and more.
  - Items will store extra items our client uses in her 'bouquets'. Some examples would include plushies, ribbons, and       baskets.
  - Clients will simply consists of her clients, as well as different methods to contact them.
  - Status will have the order numbers, the status of the order, and the client's id.
  - Orders will be the big database that links them all together. It will take from balloons and items what it needs for     said order, the client's name from the client database and the status of the order from the orders database.

The different pages will include a simple login page, a main menu page, different pages for the databases (one to view/search and another to edit for each, for a total of 9, as the orders database cannot be modified), a report page, and an options page.
  - The login page will have a welcome message and request only a password. As our client is the only one to use our         software, she doesn't need to waste time with a username, but it should still have a basic security measure.
  - The main menu will be set by default to view the order table. On the left, there will be a sidebar from which she can     choose to access any other pages from the system. That sidebar will always be there, and from it she will navigate the     web application.
  - She can choose to click on the sidebar and reveal all 5 databases. From there, by default, the view for her destination   will come up. A button will be available to switch from view to edit at any time once on the database page.
  - The report page will consits of a montly update on where she earned and spent the most money (ex: what balloons were     more popular/unpopular, what items were used, what clients are regulars, etc.). It will also give her the total earnings   of that month.
  - The options page will contain a simple theme change depending on the client's wishes.
